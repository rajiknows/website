                    I work at the intersection of systems programming,
                    distributed systems, and security—blending my love for
                    cybersecurity with creating efficient tools and
                    applications. Over the past four years, I've built
                    everything from task schedulers and monitoring tools to Web3
                    payment systems and analytics dashboards.
